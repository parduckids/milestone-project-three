## The idea: 

* "Wave & Leaf" is a dedicated recipe website designed for the vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian communities. It offers a rich collection of recipes through a modern and interactive interface, aimed at promoting healthier and more sustainable dietary choices. This platform provides a unique space for users to discover new dishes, share their favorite recipes, and connect with others who share similar dietary interests.

* "Wave & Leaf" is developed as my Milestone Project 3 for the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. This project incorporates a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and Jinja templating, backed by an SQL database. These tools were chosen to build this robust and dynamic web app.

# Design
## Overview
The website design of "Wave & Leaf" features a soothing palette of sea blues and various greens, reflecting its oceanic and botanical themes. The background incorporates a wavy design, subtly alluding to the gentle motion of the sea, aligning with the website's name and focus. This design choice enhances the siteâ€™s clear, bright, and friendly atmosphere, making it inviting and easy to navigate. To add to the user experience, "Wave & Leaf" includes beautifully animated pop-ups created using SweetAlert, providing interactive alerts that are both aesthetically pleasing and informative, enriching the overall user interaction and engagement on the site.

## Typography
* I use '[Poppins]' Google Font, which carries the same clean and easy to read design throughout the web app. Its clean lines and minimalistic letterforms create a modern and professional appearance.
* The font is imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Imagery
**Logo:** <br>
![image](/waveandleaf/static/images/logo-ts.png)


* Made with: [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
* "Wave & Leaf" uses 'wave' to represent the sea (seafood) for pescatarians and 'leaf' for plant-based ingredients, which summarizes the recipe site tailored to vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian diets with a focus on natural, wholesome foods.

**Background with Abstract wave-like shapes:** <br>

<img src="waveandleaf/static/images/pale-green.jpg" alt="pale green bg" width="200"/>
<img src="waveandleaf/static/images/sea-green.jpg" alt="sea green bg" width="200"/>
<img src="waveandleaf/static/images/deep-blue.jpg" alt="deep-blue bg" width="200"/>

* I created the background image on [Canva](https://canva.com), a graphic design platform.
* The background features a composition of abstract wave-like shapes, providing a visually attractive, quirky design. The color is changing depending on the recipe category page.

**Recipe Bubbles:** <br>

* Source: [OpenClipart](https://openclipart.org/)
* These recipe category bubbles represent vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian food.
  
**Recipe Images**
* Source: Various sources, using google image search ([Google](https://google.com/))

**Favicon** <br> <br>

## Color scheme
![image](/waveandleaf/static/readme/color-scheme.png)
* Deep Blue (#496989): A rich blue that reminds you of the deep sea. It's used for the pescatarian category page, adding a calm and deep look.

* Sea Green (#58A399): A bright and refreshing green. This color is used for the vegan category page, making it feel fresh and lively.

* Light Green (#A8CD9F): A soft, light green that's easy on the eyes. It's used throughout the site, providing a soothing touch.

* Pale Green (#E2F4C5): A very light, almost pastel green. This color is used for the vegetarian pages and for buttons, giving a gentle and inviting vibe.

## Animations and preloaders:

**Preloader with animated dots gif:** <br>

```
## Initial Setup
- The website is built using the [Code Institute's gitpod template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) provided for this project.
- Development was carried out in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), an online IDE linked to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## ElephantSQL Database Setup
- **Navigate to ElephantSQL:** Log in via [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) using the "Log in" button at the top right corner of the page.
- **Sign in with GitHub:** Choose the GitHub option for authentication and authorize ElephantSQL to access your GitHub account.
- **Create a New Team:** After logging in, add a team name, agree to the Terms of Service, confirm GDPR compliance, and provide your email.
- **Create Database Instance:** Click "Create New Instance", select the "Tiny Turtle" plan, choose a data center, and finalize the instance creation.

## Heroku Deployment
- **Create Heroku App:** Log into [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and create a new app, selecting the nearest region.
- **Configure Database:** In Heroku app settings, reveal and set Config Vars as per the env.py on the local build. Copy the database URL from ElephantSQL to Heroku's DATABASE_URL config var.
- **Connect to GitHub:** In the "Deploy" tab of your Heroku app, connect to your GitHub repository for automatic or manual deployment.
- **Deploy:** Use the "Deploy Branch" button in Heroku to start the build and deploy process.

## Final Steps
- **Post-Deployment Database Setup:** Once deployed, run the necessary database setup commands via Heroku's console to initialize the database schema.
- **Verify Deployment:** Access the app through Heroku's dashboard to ensure it is running correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Requirements and Procfile:** Ensure your project's root directory has a `requirements.txt` and a `Procfile` configured for Heroku deployment.
- **Environment Variables Adjustment:** Adjust environment variables in your Flask application to switch between local and production databases.
